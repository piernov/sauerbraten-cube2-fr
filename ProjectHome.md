Project gathering some source code modifications made by the french community from Cube2.fr (http://cube2.fr/) for Cube2: Sauerbraten (http://sauerbraten.org/), an open-source 3D engine and FPS game under the Zlib license.
Because of some license problems and other restriction like the 500MB limit of a push and a bad ADSL connection, the packages/ directory isn't included, you've to download the release package from http://sauerbraten.org/, extract this directory and place it in your git tree.
Some (outdated) screenshots are available here : http://piernov.org/images/Sauerbraten/?C=M;O=D
