These are the latest versions of SDL as at time of release:
	SDL-1.2.14.dmg
	SDL_mixer-1.2.11.dmg
	SDL_image-1.2.10.dmg

The versions of SDL within svn are much older and do not support 64bit building.
If building from svn then in xcode click on the project root and select "architectures:standard 32-bit universal".
